# Integrating RoBERTa into BERT4Rec for Enhanced Scalability and Performance

By leveraging Fairseqâ€™s powerful features, we could efficiently implement BERT4Rec with modifications suited to the needs of large-scale, sequential recommendation tasks. 
The choice of Fairseq has allowed us to focus on enhancing model performance without being constrained by implementation challenges, ultimately improving the scalability and effectiveness of the recommendation system.

This flexibility helped us integrate RoBERTa into BERT4Rec, providing a seamless way to evaluate the effectiveness of these enhancements.
