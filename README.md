# Integrating RoBERTa into BERT4Rec for Enhanced Scalability and Performance

The main goal is to integrate RoBERTa into the BERT4Rec framework to evaluate whether this integration enhances the predictive accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendation system when applied to complex datasets, compared to using the traditional BERT model.

By leveraging Fairseqâ€™s powerful features, we could efficiently implement BERT4Rec with modifications suited to the needs of large-scale, sequential recommendation tasks. 
The choice of Fairseq has allowed us to focus on enhancing model performance without being constrained by implementation challenges, ultimately improving the scalability and effectiveness of the recommendation system.

This flexibility helped us integrate RoBERTa into BERT4Rec, providing a seamless way to evaluate the effectiveness of these enhancements.
